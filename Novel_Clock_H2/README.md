# Novel Clock

In this assignment, I use each red point to represent a unit in time (seconds/ minutes/ hours). When one unit of time passes, one red point disappeared accordingly. After 60 seconds/ minutes/ 24 hours, all the red points reappear in the respective section. What's more, the color theme will change every 3 months to represent a season (spring/summer/autumn/winter). 

## Original Idea
My original idea is to create flowers on screen and make a petal fall when one unit of time passes. The appearance of flowers will vary according to the season

However, I fail to perform rotation correctly in the for loop that generate petals around the center of a flower. Due to the time limit, I reduce the project to points.

# Final Project Proposal
## Idea
For the final project, I want to explore interactive 3D avatars using threejs, ml5, and firebase. 
The 3D avatar will follow the body movements of users. Users can change and customize the avatar through clicking. Users can click on the floor and the avatar will walk to the clicked spot. When multiple users are online, multiple avatars appear in the scene.

## Inspiration

2. <https://tympanus.net/codrops/2021/10/04/creating-3d-characters-in-three-js/>
3. <https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/posenet>

## anticipated challenges
1. Customizable model making (now thinking of using a couple of avatars with different clothes and hairstyle)
2. Map the posenet data to the 3D avatar's rig
3. Store users' model data in firebase
4. click to walk

## Schedule
By April 25: prepare model and animation, firebase and ml5 connection
By May 2: Threejs scene construction and interaction making
